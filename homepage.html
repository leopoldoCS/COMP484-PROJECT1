Tyler's music evolved over the years, moving from shock value to more personal, and experimental sounds.
Later albums like Wolf 2013, Cherry Bomb 2015, and Flower Boy 2017 shot him even higher into the spotlight.
In 2019, his album IGOR won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, making his respect as a creator grow.
He followed up with Call Me If You Get Lost 2022, which he recieved his second grammy.
